This is my attempt to ease out repetitive LEO tasks targeting mainly at RP students. Deployed on Google App Engine. Add rpleobot@appspot.com on google talk to try it out. Currently support these features:

1. /grades      to check out the recently published grades
2. /rj          to check out RJ question of the day ( includes submission status )
3. /timetable   to check out the timetable
4. /ce          view CE points status
5. /gpa         view cumulative GPA
6. /me          view personal particulars
